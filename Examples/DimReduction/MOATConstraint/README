***************************************************************
The following simple problem is used to show how to perform
Morris screening analysis with inequality constraints.

Y = X1 + X2 + X3 + ... X20

subject to 0 <= X1 + X2 <= 1

X1, X2, .., X20 = [0, 1]

***************************************************************
The idea is to modify the first 2 inputs of the unconstrained
GMOAT sample based on the MOAT_repair_file information created
by applying constraints.

The steps are:

1. generate a sample expressing the constraints (X1+X2)
   It is in genConstraint.c

   so: cc -o genConstraint genConstraint.c -lm

   now run: psuade psuadeGenConstraint.in

   mv psuadeData constrData

2. generate a Morris sample for X1 and X2 that obeys the 
   constraint

   psuade
   > load constrData
   > moatgen
     1   < choose linear regression >
     0   < lower bound for constraint = 0 >
     1   < upper bound for constraint = 1 >
     8   < resolution: use numbers >= 6 >
     200 < just use a large number >
   > quit
 
   At the end a file MOAT_repair_file is generated.

   Next, go into the MOAT_repair_file and change
   the variable indices on line 3. In this case,
   since the variables are 1 and 2, so no change is
   needed.

3. generate a Morris sample for 20 inputs but do not run

   psuade psuadeGMOAT.in

   mv psuadeData gmoatSample

4. repair the Morris sample (repair the first 2 inputs only)

   psuade
   > load gmoatSample
   > gmoat_adjust MOAT_repair_file
   > write gmoatSample.repaired
   > quit

   Now gmoatSample.repaired is ready to be run.

5. run simulations on the modified GMOAT sample

   cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm

   Open up gmoatSample.repaired, and change the 
       driver to point to simulator.

   Now do: psuade gmoatSample.repaired
 
   mv psuadeData gmoatSample.repaired.done

6. perform analysis

   Open up gmoatSample.repaired.done.
   Change the line moat_constraint to:
     analyzer moat_constraint = constr_file indexFile 0 1

   Now start psuade in command line mode:

   psuade
   > load gmoatSample.repaired.done
   > moat
