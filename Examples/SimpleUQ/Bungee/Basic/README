Bungee problem
=============================================================
To run:

cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuade.in

This will create a file called called psuadeData with 300
samples that have already been run. Rename this file to be
called psSave.

(1) to perform uncertainty analysis on the raw sample

    - psuade
      > load psSave
      > ua (or ca)

(2) to perform response surface analysis 

    - psuade
      > load psSave
      > rscheck
      Choose any response surface type
      Say yes to cross validation with maybe 10 groups and 
          random pick
      Afterward you should see a RSFA_CV_err.m file that 
          you can visualize the CV results (with matlab
          or scilab - for scilab, issue a 'scilab' command
          before calling 'rscheck'.

(2) to perform main effect analysis using response surface

    - psuade
      > load psSave
      > rssobol1
      Enter your selected response surfac type

(3) to perform pairwise interaction analysis

    - psuade
      > load psSave
      > rssobol2

(4) to perform total order analysis

    - psuade
      > load psSave
      > rssoboltsi

(5) to perform group-based order analysis

    - psuade
      > load psSave
      > rssobolg
      Use 'grpfile' to specify groupings

(6) to generate response surface or sample plots

    - psuade
      > load psSave
      > <use rs1, rs2, or rs3 for response surfaces, or 
         iplot1, iplot2 .. for scatter plots>

=============================================================
To experiment with user regression:

cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuade.in
mv psuadeData psSave

psuade
> load psSave
> rscheck
  choose user regression

  enter number of terms = 10 (see user_regression.py file)
  enter executable = user_regression.py

=============================================================
To experiment with selective regression:

cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuade.in
mv psuadeData psSave

psuade
> load psSave
> rscheck
  choose selective regression
  (selective_regression_file is needed for this analysis.
   This file is also present in this directory and will be
   detected automatically

=============================================================
To experiment with Legendre regression:

cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuade.in
mv psuadeData psSave

psuade
> load psSave
> rscheck
  choose Legendre regression
  enter order (e.g. 2 or 3)

=============================================================
To experiment with GradLegendre regression:

cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuadeDeriv.in
mv psuadeData psSave

psuade
> load psSave (This file contains both simulation outputs and
               3 derivatives with respect to 3 inputs)
> rscheck
  Select output 1 (this is supposed to be the main output)
  choose gradLegendre
  NO CV is available for this.

=============================================================
Scripts/psScript.misctest.in - many different tests
Scripts/psScript.misctest.out - a snippet of outputs

Do: First, copy psScript.misctest.in up one directory
    Then, psuade < psScript.misctest.in > outfile
    Compare (values only) outfile psScript.misctest.out

=============================================================

Scripts/psScript.rstest.in - many different response surface tests
Scripts/psScript.rstest.out - a snippet of outputs
 
Do: First, copy psScript.rstest.in up one directory
    Then, psuade < psScript.rstest.in > outfile
    Compare (values only) outfile psScript.rstest.out

=============================================================
Psuade sends out max_parallel_jobs samples in a single batch
each time it calls ensemble_simulator (in this case 
max_parallel_jobs=10 and nSamples=300 so psuade sends 30
batches of 10 samples each time. Users are expected to
take the 10 samples and parallelize their runs based on
the user parallel system configuration).
-------------------------------------------------------------

Scripts/psScript.ensemble.in  - using ensemble runs
Scripts/psScript.ensemble.out - a snippet of outputs

Do: First, copy psScript.ensemble.in up one directory
    psuade < psScript.ensemble.in > outfile
    Compare (values only) outfile psScript.ensemble.out
