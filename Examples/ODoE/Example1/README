This directory contains a few examples for optimal experimental 
design.
* max-min distance or MMD
  - The command is odoe_mmd, meaning max-min distance (the 
    selected set will have minimum distance between any pair 
    of selected points maximized).
* min-max variance or MMV
  - The command is odoe_mmv, meaning searching for design that
    minimizes the maximum variance predicted by GP.
* min-average variance or MAV
  - The command is odoe_mav, meaning searching for design that
    minimizes the average variance (over the candidate set) 
    predicted by GP.

Steps
==============================================================
I. MMD

   Users are to provide a candidate set for selection. To do
   so, run
   - psuade psuade.in
   - mv psuadeData Sample

   Now Sample contains the candidate set, now you can launch
   psuade and run odoe_mmv. The command will ask you many 
   questions. To capture the selection, you can run 

      psuade < psScriptmmd1.in
 
   to see the action.

   Here: psScriptmmdx.in use different methods for search
  
   psScriptmmd1.in: unweighted scheme 
      (option 1 after odoe_mmd), use brute force search
   psScriptmmd2.in: unweighted scheme 
      (option 1 after odoe_mmd), use global optimizer
   psScriptmmd3.in: unweighted scheme 
      (option 1 after odoe_mmd), use hybrid optimizer
   
   * mmd1 and mmd3 runs should give same results (optimal).

* You can also use weighted MMD methods. To use this capability,
  you need to provide weights for each candidate point. This is
  done by an additional step:

  - compile simulator.c (cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm)
  - uncomment the 'driver = ./driver' line
  - run: psuade psuade.in (the same as before)
  - rename psuadeData as Sample (same as before)

  run:
    psScriptmmd1w.in: weighted scheme 
      (option 2 after odoe_mmd), use brute force search
    psScriptmmd2w.in: weighted scheme 
      (option 2 after odoe_mmd), use global optimizer
    psScriptmmd3w.in: weighted scheme 
      (option 2 after odoe_mmd), use hybrid optimizer

* We see that using global optimizer does not guarantee the
  optimal results. While brute force search may take a long 
  time for large selection, hybrid optimizer may be a good 
  compromise.
==============================================================
II. MMV 

   To use this method, you need to build a Gaussian process
   model. This can be done in 2 ways:
   a. use a training sample
   b. provide GP hyperparameters

   To do (a), you need to do things similar to the weighted
   MMD method, namely, 

     cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
     # uncomment the 'driver = ./driver' line in psuade.in
     psuade psuade.in
     mv psuadeData Sample
     # then, after launching psuade and before calling
     # odoe_mmv, load Sample first

   To do (b), you just need to come up with values of the
   hyperparameters (and you do not need to generate a
   sample, as there is an option for psuade to create one
   for you). Now you are ready to run odoe_mmv.
   
   run: psuade < psScriptmmv.in

   (This setup runs using (b) with hyperparameters=10)
   (It requests an exhaustive search so it is time-consuming)

==============================================================
III. MAV 

    The steps for setting up and running are similar to MMV. 

    run: psuade < psScriptmav.in
