This case runs inference with discrepancy modeling

I. To run inference, do: psuade < script.mcmc

   You will see something like this:

   Input   1 =   5.96935775e-01
   Input   2 =   4.99999554e-01
   MLE Negative log likelihood =  2.3925e-09
   MCMC_BF: input   2 value at maximum likelihood = 4.999996e-01
   MCMC_BF: input   2 mean    = 4.999978e-01
   MCMC_BF: input   2 std dev = 9.088607e-03

   - so the value of beta that best matches data is ~0.5, which
     is the set value
   - the negative log likelihood is ~0 so it is good
   - the standard deviation of the posterior distribution of beta 
     is 0.009 

II. Now use the posterior sample for prediction

    psuade < script.post

    The evaluation is at X=0.5 so according to the true formula
    (Ye = Beta * X / (1 + X / 20) where Beta=0.65)

    The predicted value = 0.31705 with s.d. ~ 0.004

    The true Y = 0.65 * 0.5 / (1 + 0.025) = 0.317
