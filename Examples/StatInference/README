DiscTest - inference with discrepancy 
MultiModel - posterior is multi-modal
PMCMC - parallel MCMC

***********************************************************************
PSUADE statistical inference package performs response-surface-based
Bayesian inferences. As such, it requires
- a sample (evaluated) for building response surfaces
- an experimental file 
  Note: users can embed experimental comparison within their samples
        (that is, sample outputs are square roots of negative log 
        likelihoods) and then use a 'manufactured' experimental file 
        with zero mean and unit standard deviation. The inference 
        engine will then exponentiate the square root of negative 
        logLikelihood (negLL) during MCMC (that is, compute 
        exp(-0.5*(negLL-mean)^2/std^2))

Since statistical inference using response surfaces is relatively
cheap computationally, 2 inference methods are provided in PSUADE:
- brute force (not smart sampling such as MCMC)
- MCMC with multiple chains and Gibbs sampling

Note: it turns out that in many cases the brute force method may
      be faster than the MCMC because Gibbs searching may be
      expensive (Metropolis-Hastings has not been implemented).
      If high dimensions or when the posterior is focused in a
      tiny region, the brute force method may have problems, but
      so does Gibbs.
=======================================================================
Inference with discrepancy models:
There are five ways discrepancy models can be incorporated in inference
but only two are provided in PSUADE:
- A constant discrepancy function
- A discrepancy model as a function of the design variables

If you select discrepancy modeling, you need to specify the point 
(the values of the uncertain parameters) at which the discrepancy
function is to be created. This will in default be the midpoint of 
the uncertain parameter ranges.

The discrepancy function may be created by
a. subtracting the simulation outputs from the experimental data at
   the experimental conditions
b. a response surface constructed from the results of (a)

If the results of (a) cannot be fitted well with a response surface,
then the posteriors will still be valid, but if you are to use the
posteriors as well as the discrepancy model for prediction, it may
have large errors (because a response surface will be needed for the 
discrepancy model to perform prediction)
***********************************************************************
At the end of inference, and in the matlabmcmc2.m file (which can be
used to display the posterior plots), there will be MLE negative log
likelihood value. If that value is far from 0, then you may need to
use discrepancy model, because the simulation results and experimental
data appear to be far apart.
